# From Signals to Distress: A Time-Aware Machine Learning Framework for ST Classification in China‚Äôs Capital Market

## Overview

This project presents a time-aware machine learning framework designed to predict whether listed companies in China's A-share market are likely to receive the "Special Treatment" (ST) classification, which serves as a regulatory indicator of financial distress. By combining multi-period financial indicators, classical machine learning models, and SHAP-based interpretability, this study captures the temporal dynamics underlying corporate deterioration.

## Highlights

- **Dataset**: Firm-level quarterly financial data from 2015Q1 to 2019Q4.
- **Target**: 51 ST-labeled firms in 2019 vs. matched non-ST counterparts.
- **Features**: 11 core financial ratios with $t$, $t-1$, and $t-2$ lags (33 total features).
- **Models Used**: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost.
- **Techniques**:
  - Data preprocessing (standardization, outlier removal, IQR filtering).
  - Sample balancing using **KNN-matching** and **SMOTE**.
  - SHAP for model interpretation and temporal importance analysis.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Due to the large size of processed `.csv` and intermediate `.txt` files (e.g., full lag-augmented datasets, raw CSMAR exports, and SMOTE results), these files are excluded from the GitHub repository.
